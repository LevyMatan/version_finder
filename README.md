   - Core Library only
   - Core Library and CLI
   - Core Library and GUI
   - All

   Please note that this installation does not inlude the requierments for development.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the `version_finder` command-line tool. Here are some example commands:

```bash
version_finder --gui                            # Run the GUI
version-finder --cli                            # Run the CLI
version_finder -p /path/to/repo                 # Find versions in specified repository
version_finder -v                               # Run with verbose output
version_finder --timeout 60                     # Set git operation timeout to 60 seconds
```

For a full list of options, run:

```bash
version_finder --help
```

### Direct Interaction

You can invoke a simple version finder with:

```bash
version_finder -p /path/to/repo -b target_branch -c target_commit [-s submodule_path]
```

This will find the first version containing the target commit within the target branch.

### CLI

The CLI will enable user to interact with the library in a more interactive way.
The first step will be to select the repository to work on.
After that, the user will be asked to select the branch to work on.

Now the user will given the option to choose a TASK to perform.
Based on the task chosen, user will have to enter additional information.
Tasks include:

- Find the first version containing a specific commit
- Find the first version containing a specific commit in a specific submodule
- Show all commits between two versions
- Show all commits between two versions in a specific submodule

### GUI

Reveales the same functionality as the CLI, but with a GUI interface.
It also provides instant feedback for parameter correctness and hints in the form of autocomplete.

## Code Structure

The Version Finder utility is structured as follows:

- `version_finder/__main__.py`: Contains the a gateway to the library and will preform a simple task or open CLI or GUI.
- `version_finder/core.py`: Implements the `VersionFinder` class, which handles Git operations, branch handling, and version extraction.
- `version_finder/logger.py`: Sets up logging for the application
- `version_finder/protocols.py`: Defines protocol classes for type hinting
- `version_finder/__cli__.py`: Defines the CLI interface for the application
- `version_finder/__gui__.py`: Defines the GUI interface for the application
- `version_finder/__common__.py`: Defines common utility functions for both CLI and GUI

### Core Components

1. `VersionFinder` class:
   - Manages Git repository operations
   - Handles submodules and branches
   - Performs version extraction and retrieves commit information

2. CLI Interface:
   - Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the application
   - Provides an interactive interface for selecting branches
   - Executes version finding operations based on user input
